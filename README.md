Personal Blog created with Jekyll
Feel free to use this template if you want, also any code within.

### push_site.sh
This small script is something I made to make my remote changes easier.
Just substitute in your own server login details.

I use rsync insted of scp as rsync only submits changed files. 
So what this does is pull all changes that are made in 
the __site_ directory and send 'em straight to your remote /www/ folder.
### Todo
* Need to finish Jekyll and Digital Ocean blog post.
* Update about page
* Restyle inline code highlighting
