So I've finally got my website up and running.

I aim to update this blog frequently with many different subjects.
Currently my focus includes React JS with regards to programming, however shortly I will be uploading
a post on how to get simple Jekyll website up and running with a VPS, particularly Digital Ocean.

It won't involve a lot of different technologies, and it may appear a bit hacky, but it works a charm.

Some posts on Hungarian grammar concepts will be coming too. These posts will detail certain grammatical structures within the language that I have found particularly tricky or not so easy to find on the internet.
I'll also be sharing my thoughts on language acquisition, techniques I use and other things to improve my vocabulary.

Stay tuned, folks!
