We will be discussing the situations in which Hungarian 'igekötő' are split from the verb.

As a side note, we won't be concentrating on the many degrees of specificity you can have in a sentence.

For example:

`Tegnap néztük meg a filmet (and not 'ma')` - Yesterday, we watched the film. (Not today!)

Versus

`Tegnap megnéztük a filmet` - We watched the film yesterday (neutral sentence, no degree of specificity)
